1
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,881
You think you know the truth about him?
You know nothing.

2
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:51,384
You know nothing.

3
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,058
His father was Zeus. The Zeus.

4
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,144
King of the gods.

5
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:08,484
His mother, Alcmene, a mortal woman.

6
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,196
Together, they had a boy.

7
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,157
Half human,

8
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,659
half god.

9
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:24,584
But Zeus' queen, Hera,
saw this bastard child as an insult,

10
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,879
a living reminder of
her husband's infidelity.

11
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,382
Alcmene named the boy Hercules,

12
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:33,634
which means "glory of Hera,"

13
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,721
but this failed to appease the goddess.

14
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,724
She wanted him dead.

15
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,662
Luckily, he took after his father.

16
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,458
Once he reached manhood,

17
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:08,544
the gods commanded him
to perform Twelve Labors,

18
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,255
twelve dangerous missions.

19
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,925
If he completed them all and survived,

20
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,886
Hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace.

21
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,157
He fought the Lernean Hydra!

22
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:54,257
He battled the Erymanthean Boar!

23
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:11,023
But his greatest Labor
was the Nemean Lion.

24
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,531
This was no ordinary beast.

25
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,996
It had a hide so tough,
no weapon could penetrate it.

26
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,679
But even this monster was no match
for the son of Zeus.

27
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,976
What a load of crap!

28
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,644
Every word is true.

29
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,608
You know what I think?

30
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,527
This friend of yours doesn't even exist.

31
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,030
Laugh all you want.

32
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,992
He's coming. And be warned, Gryza,
he despises pirates.

33
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,828
Macedonia has been good to us.

34
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,789
Plenty of villages ripe for pillaging.

35
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,207
We are here to stay.

36
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,542
Finish him.

37
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,340
The more you struggle,
the faster you drop.

38
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,385
Indeed, your fleet is strong. I...

39
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,936
Yet, as I was about to explain
before I was so rudely interrupted,

40
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,063
the Nemean Lion was strong, too.

41
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,815
Yet, he still destroyed it.

42
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,736
And not with a sword
or a spear or arrows. No!

43
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,825
I did it with my bare hands!

44
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,455
Or so they say.

45
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,210
Hercules.

46
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:55,920
Is this all the men you have?

47
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,965
There's 40 of us. One of you.

48
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,927
The king of this land
has offered me gold to dispose of you.

49
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,930
So leave, or die.

50
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,765
I get paid either way.

51
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,060
Make him bleed.

52
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,860
Five men with a single blow.

53
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,822
Still think you can destroy
the son of Zeus?

54
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:24,907
Bring me his head!

55
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,996
Seems they need
more convincing, Autolycus.

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,414
That's why we're here.

57
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,001
Atalanta.

58
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,505
Amphiaraus.

59
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,759
May Zeus forgive you.

60
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,469
Tydeus?

61
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,785
Die, Hercules!

62
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,792
Good man.

63
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,430
Hurry!

64
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:31,348
Hurry! Uncle!

65
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:34,560
Uncle, hurry!

66
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,312
Hurry! Hurry!

67
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,817
Any longer, Uncle...

68
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:44,862
And the girls would finally be safe
from your attentions.

69
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,493
The rest of you may go.

70
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,995
But not you.

71
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,759
Thirteen,

72
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:10,387
14, 15, 16,

73
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:14,308
- 17, 18, 19, 20.
- That was fun.

74
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:18,437
Twenty pirates
at two gold pieces a head,

75
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,564
minus the headless ones. Let's see.

76
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:21,732
Not a bad night.

77
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,528
You see how the pirates ran?
My story softened their resolve.

78
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,905
Their resolve must be broken, Iolaus.

79
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:29,740
When you spread
the legend of Hercules,

80
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,992
make it bigger, scarier.

81
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,079
The more they believe
Hercules is truly the son of Zeus,

82
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,747
the less likely they are to fight.

83
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,380
Amphiaraus?

84
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,382
Care to join us here on Earth?

85
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:56,559
A lion and a crow in strange alliance,
fighting across a sea of corpses.

86
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,402
If you're going to use those herbs,
Amphiaraus, at least share.

87
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,454
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

88
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,874
Fight it!

89
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,751
Keep practicing, boys!

90
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,421
So who's next? You? You?

91
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,426
That's a pretty sight.

92
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,887
One more payday, Autolycus,
that's all we need.

93
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:35,931
Then we get to live like
the kings we've served.

94
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,309
Or live simply.

95
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,438
You still dreaming of barbarian lands?

96
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,025
Beyond the Aegean.
At the shores of the Black Sea.

97
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,111
That is where I will live out
the rest of my days in solitude.

98
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,363
Boring, if you ask me.

99
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,157
Maybe so, Autolycus.

100
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:56,577
But I'll never find peace unless
I move as far away as possible.

101
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,204
What of Tydeus?

102
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:02,166
Without you to temper his rage,
I fear what he may become.

103
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,293
Tydeus will go with me.

104
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,129
Civilization has become
too civilized for us.

105
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,464
Uncle!

106
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,551
Join us.
The girls are eager to welcome you.

107
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,604
See? I told you I knew Hercules.

108
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,690
Are you his servant?

109
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,359
I'm his nephew.

110
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,485
Are you, really?

111
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,278
I tell of Hercules' Twelve Labors,

112
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:34,031
like the Nemean Lion,
the Apples of the Hesperides,

113
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,240
the Belt of Hippolyta

114
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,327
with its buxom naked Amazons
and exciting bondage.

115
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,997
- I immortalize him...
- He talks, while the rest of us fight.

116
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:45,501
It is a wonder
you share the same blood as Hercules.

117
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,503
Have fun.

118
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,546
Ladies.

119
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,485
What do you want with Hercules?

120
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,320
My words are for him, not you.

121
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,572
Atalanta, it's all right.

122
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,289
You certainly are a hard man to find.

123
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,375
Maybe I don't want anyone to find me.

124
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,252
I'm not just anyone.

125
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,046
My name is Ergenia,
daughter to Lord Cotys.

126
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,383
Your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir.

127
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,804
My father is most unfortunate.

128
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,056
He battles a warlord, Rhesus.

129
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,475
Our land is torn by civil war.

130
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,395
Every day, villages are destroyed,
crops ruined, innocents slaughtered.

131
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,397
We all have problems.

132
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:54,361
Well, perhaps I can convince you
to make our problems your own.

133
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,031
Unfortunately, My Lady,

134
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,283
Hercules is fully committed
till the Feast of Dionysus.

135
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,909
We could, however,

136
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,246
advance you to the front of the line,
for the right price.

137
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,249
I thought heroes fight for glory.

138
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,293
But mercenaries fight for gold.

139
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,128
Lord Cotys is a rich man.

140
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,504
I like him already.

141
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:16,258
If you agree to aid him,
he will pay your weight in gold.

142
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,722
Eat up.

143
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,646
"A lion and crow in strange alliance."

144
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,815
Told you.

145
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,239
Where are we going?

146
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,344
It is good to see you safe, My Lady.

147
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,519
This war claims more victims every day.
We were concerned, My Lady.

148
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:53,730
Thank you, General Sitacles.
I was well protected.

149
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,360
The mighty Hercules. An honor.

150
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,531
Though not quite as big an honor
as I expected.

151
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,368
General, go tell my father
Hercules is here.

152
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,625
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

153
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,419
It's meant to be.

154
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:18,964
It took five years and a thousand men
to build her temple.

155
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,383
Hera is the patron goddess of Thrace.

156
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,846
Everyone knows the legend,
how Hera seeks to destroy Hercules.

157
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,391
Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

158
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,851
Mother!

159
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,686
Arius.

160
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,275
- You're Hercules.
- That's right.

161
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,736
My name is Arius.
I know all your Labors by heart.

162
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,864
You killed the giant Geryon
with a single blow,

163
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,741
cleaned the Augean stables
in one night.

164
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:46,867
Hercules is probably tired.

165
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,702
And the Labor of the Hide,
and the Labor of the Mares.

166
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,412
That's enough, Arius. Come along.

167
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,289
Stay away from him.

168
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,083
Men who deal in violence
attract violence.

169
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,503
But he's Hercules. He's no mere mortal.
He's the greatest!

170
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:03,425
Lord Cotys will see you now.

171
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,643
Have you ever met royalty, Hercules?

172
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,646
Once or twice.

173
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:33,664
Father!

174
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,254
Megara.

175
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,925
Welcome home, my love.

176
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:52,933
Hercules!

177
00:14:56,771 --> 00:15:00,774
Whenever I'm here, I imagine
this is what Elysium must look like.

178
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,821
Well, men like us have the means
to create our own paradise on Earth.

179
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,322
Look.

180
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,907
Magnificent, aren't they?

181
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:14,496
Well, do not keep us in suspense.
Are we safe from the monster Hydra?

182
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,334
The Hydra's heads, Your Majesty.

183
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,511
The masks of serpents.

184
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,597
No wonder men thought
they were monsters.

185
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:36,018
You've done your sovereign
a great service. Come.

186
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,021
Let the people have their hero.

187
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,733
All hail King Eurystheus.

188
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,153
And the mighty protector of Athens,

189
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,697
Hercules!

190
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,118
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

191
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,539
A man faced with such adoration
might be tempted to think himself a god.

192
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:02,044
I only want to be
a husband and a father.

193
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,261
Lord Cotys awaits.

194
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,699
Hercules.

195
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,577
Welcome.

196
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,581
An honor to host such a legend.

197
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,750
Lord Cotys.

198
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,420
But in legend, you fight alone.

199
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,758
My reputation would not exist
without my comrades.

200
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,302
Autolycus of Sparta.

201
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,431
Tydeus of Thebes.

202
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,185
Atalanta of Scythia.

203
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,271
Iolaus of Athens.

204
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,483
And Amphiaraus of Argos.

205
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,901
Amphiaraus?

206
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,114
The famed seer of Argos.

207
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,534
It is said you have glimpsed
your own death,

208
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,287
so you fight each battle knowing that
it is not yet your time to die.

209
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,957
What else can you tell of the future?

210
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,918
Only what the gods see fit to reveal.

211
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,002
A shame.

212
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,339
It would have been a great gift
to know the outcome of this war.

213
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:33,135
The gods can be frustrating sometimes,
Lord Cotys.

214
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:44,354
With respect, I fear that the task ahead
might not be suitable for a woman,

215
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,566
even if she is an Amazon warrior.

216
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,741
I stand corrected.

217
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,080
When the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel,

218
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,333
it was intended as
the high seat of all Thrace.

219
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,795
But now Thrace is divided.

220
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,755
This war has depleted our forces.

221
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,551
We're left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army.

222
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,761
It takes every one of us
to resist Rhesus.

223
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,265
People think that he cannot be killed
by an ordinary mortal.

224
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,392
Only by a god.

225
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,437
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

226
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,065
His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.

227
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,819
He leads an army of monsters,
half horse, half human.

228
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,031
Centaurs?

229
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,992
- You've actually seen them?
- They have been seen.

230
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,497
Come, Hercules.

231
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,209
Let me show you what misery
Rhesus has brought us.

232
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:54,966
Every week, more refugees arrive
seeking my protection,

233
00:18:55,134 --> 00:19:00,222
most of them covered in blood,
crippled or burnt by Rhesus' men.

234
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:04,476
I feared nothing could ever
be good again, till you arrived.

235
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,312
I'm just a mercenary fighting for gold.

236
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:12,359
How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

237
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,903
How others perceive us is important.

238
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,906
And your name, like it or not,

239
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,283
is a rallying cry.

240
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:30,126
I have seen too much reality
to trust in legends, and I am not alone.

241
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:33,547
Nobody has any faith anymore.

242
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:38,760
The people need a hero.
They need someone to look up to.

243
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,139
My son believes in you.

244
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,600
Bring us peace,

245
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,771
and I will believe in you, too.

246
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:00,031
I'm convinced these are good people.

247
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,160
I see. And who's more convincing,
Cotys or his daughter?

248
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,205
All the gold on Earth is not
as convincing as a pair of breasts.

249
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,541
Maybe, but gold never ages.

250
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,918
Which is why
I got them to double our price.

251
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,255
Double your weight in gold? Well done.

252
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,381
Amphiaraus?

253
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,882
If it be the will of Zeus.

254
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,343
Which title sounds more terrifying
to our enemies?

255
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,014
"Hercules: Savior of Thrace"
or "Hercules: A Legend is Born"?

256
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,641
Both sound terrifyingly boring.

257
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,811
What are we supposed to do
with an army of farmers?

258
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,024
Train them.

259
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,734
Oh, shit.

260
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,494
In war, there is one thing
more important than killing.

261
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,371
Surviving.

262
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,126
My companions and I will show you
how to stay alive,

263
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,172
so that you may return home
to your farms someday.

264
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:00,967
Autolycus.

265
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,678
Shield wall! Form!

266
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,240
Corpses! Every last one of you!

267
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,077
Because your shield wall was weak.

268
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,578
Dead.

269
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,372
Dead.

270
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,207
Very dead.

271
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,293
Soldier,

272
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,587
many lives depend on you.

273
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,757
When attacked,
lock your feet in the ground.

274
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,803
You understand?

275
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,221
Yes, sir.

276
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,765
When a shield wall is strong,

277
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,893
nothing can ever defeat it!

278
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,605
You must learn to work together,
react together.

279
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:59,943
When you do, each individual
will become a link in a chain

280
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,362
that will be stronger than iron.

281
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,993
I hope the enemy has a sense of humor.

282
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:14,374
Right. Today's lesson,
how not to stab yourselves!

283
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,463
It is imperative that we strike now,
My Lord, given this opportunity.

284
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:22,716
There you are!

285
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:27,262
Hercules, my scouts have brought news.
Rhesus is on the move.

286
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,222
Archers who shoot lightning
from their bows.

287
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,017
And infantry 4,000-strong,
their minds bewitched.

288
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,644
Demons march with them.

289
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,438
So now we're fighting demons.

290
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,482
No stranger than the monsters
I hear you faced, Hercules.

291
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:43,361
My Lord, Rhesus is preparing
to attack Bessi lands.

292
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,613
He will be on them within six days.

293
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,325
If the Bessi fall, we're next.
Unless we intercept him.

294
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,662
Your men need weeks, if not months,
of training before they're ready.

295
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:56,458
The Bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

296
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,627
If we do not protect them,
then there will be a bloodbath.

297
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,713
Face Rhesus with an untrained army

298
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,631
and you risk losing
far more than a single battle.

299
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,969
My Lord, Rhesus is coming.
I vouch my life on it.

300
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,139
The longer Rhesus lives,

301
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,977
the more villages will be burnt
and the more innocents will be killed.

302
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,689
Assemble your men.
We march tomorrow.

303
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:25,862
Hercules,
the gods have offered us a gift.

304
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:28,072
We must not squander it.

305
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:30,784
Are your gods going to
be fighting with us?

306
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,410
No.

307
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,246
The son of Zeus will.

308
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:53,014
I've seen how you watch over Hercules.

309
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,685
Tell me,

310
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,480
how did a woman,

311
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,274
beautiful woman,

312
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,444
fall in with these hardened men?

313
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:07,695
Killers?

314
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,119
Son of Zeus need
a woman's protection?

315
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,996
I don't protect him.

316
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,542
I protect you from him.

317
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:47,569
General, from now on, maybe you
should favor the company of your men.

318
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,203
He pulled a knife?

319
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,873
It was only a small prick.

320
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,999
Your mother told you to stay away.
You should listen.

321
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,376
What's wrong with him?

322
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,299
Tydeus is my most loyal warrior.

323
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:54,260
He was born in war.

324
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:58,598
When I found him,
he was more animal than human.

325
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:04,520
He never speaks of what he saw.

326
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,106
He never speaks at all.

327
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:10,777
But he relives it every night.

328
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,696
Come.

329
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,281
Let's find your mother.

330
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:25,208
When I grow up,
I want to be a great hero like you.

331
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,169
- Like me?
- No hero is greater than Hercules.

332
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,420
I know all your Labors.

333
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:33,341
Like the Cretan Bull, you wrestled it
for seven days and seven nights.

334
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,550
That's a bit exaggerated.

335
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:38,429
- And struck it 49 times with your club.
- Maybe not quite that many.

336
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:42,183
Until it fell dead and Crete was saved.
It's my favorite Labor.

337
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,352
Also Queen Hippolyta's Belt,

338
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,730
with its buxom Amazons
and exciting bondage.

339
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:51,609
- Do you even know what that means?
- No.

340
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,496
- Mother.
- Arius.

341
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,832
You're supposed to be in bed.

342
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,836
Why are you in the hospice?

343
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,879
My mother saves people's lives.

344
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,841
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

345
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,177
So, out of necessity,
I taught myself the art of healing.

346
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,097
If I could be like you,

347
00:27:21,265 --> 00:27:24,851
I would protect all of Thrace
and no one would ever get hurt.

348
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,361
Here.

349
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,532
I was going to give this
to someone else,

350
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,994
but I never got the chance.

351
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,706
Only a hero may wear this.

352
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,751
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

353
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,089
Is this the Nemean Lion's tooth?

354
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,467
- It is.
- Thank you.

355
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,594
Thank you.

356
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
Good night.

357
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:03,222
Good night, Hercules.

358
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,395
Have no fear.

359
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,193
If you fall in the service of a just cause,
your souls will go to Elysium,

360
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,489
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes,

361
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:20,907
like Theseus.

362
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,158
Odysseus!

363
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,327
And the great Achilles.

364
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,331
Or if you're lucky, you'll go to Hades,
where all the fun people are.

365
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,924
Iolaus.

366
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,259
Your place is beside Lord Cotys,
where it's safe.

367
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,429
I've been giving it a lot of thought,
and I really feel I'm ready to fight.

368
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,014
You're a storyteller, not a warrior.

369
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,182
We share the same blood.

370
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,768
And I will not see it shed. Chariot.

371
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,186
Now.

372
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,695
Thracians,

373
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,491
the shield wall is your home.
Your shelter.

374
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,869
When you sleep,
the wall is your blanket.

375
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:10,790
When you fight, the wall is your armor.

376
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:13,626
The shield wall will
never break formation

377
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,546
as long as there is breath in your body.

378
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,257
Remember these words,

379
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,260
and you will taste victory.

380
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,680
- Move the army out!
- Move out!

381
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,790
Halt!

382
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:36,542
Halt!

383
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,920
- Halt!
- Halt!

384
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,244
We are too late.

385
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,081
Rhesus has already been here.

386
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,837
Leave the chariots.
We'll go down on foot.

387
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,411
The lion and crow
cross a field of corpses.

388
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,456
I hate being right all the time.

389
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,088
Halt.

390
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,715
- Halt!
- Halt!

391
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,060
This head is rotting.

392
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,731
A week old, at least.

393
00:32:25,027 --> 00:32:27,486
Yet some of these bodies are fresh.

394
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,711
Uncle!

395
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,931
And we've walked into a trap.

396
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,525
Shield wall! Form a single square!
Protect Lord Cotys! Iolaus, go!

397
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,277
Shield wall!

398
00:33:17,746 --> 00:33:20,456
We're here to help them.
Why are they attacking?

399
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,083
This is Rhesus' doing.

400
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:24,668
They say his spells have
the power to cloud minds.

401
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,463
Turn comrades against each other.

402
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:37,515
King's guards, around Lord Cotys!

403
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,984
Amphiaraus, do we die in this battle?

404
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:53,239
My time's not come yet.
Not sure about yours.

405
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:56,826
That's comforting.

406
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,460
I think he wants a challenge.

407
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:30,151
Hercules' fists have been dipped
in the blood of the Hydra!

408
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:32,570
Lethal to anyone but him!

409
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,448
Watch!

410
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,879
Did you see that?

411
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,380
The gods fight on our side!

412
00:34:54,176 --> 00:34:57,052
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

413
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,972
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

414
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,765
Hercules! Hercules!

415
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,685
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

416
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,409
Battle position!

417
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:32,838
Lady Artemis, if I am to fall,
let me be judged...

418
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,165
Stand fast!

419
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,391
Hold your position!

420
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,616
Do not yield!

421
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,925
No retreat! Stay in the wall!

422
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,762
Hold the lines!

423
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:46,513
Do not yield!

424
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:49,183
Defend Lord Cotys!

425
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,544
The wall has been breached!

426
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,927
Seal up the shield wall!
Defend Lord Cotys!

427
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,393
Whip!

428
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,321
Hercules!

429
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,281
Bring the chariots!

430
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:55,916
Defend your Lord!

431
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,929
No!

432
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,006
Advance!

433
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:27,883
Advance!

434
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:47,528
Make way!

435
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,291
Where is Rhesus?

436
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,689
Lord Cotys.

437
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,693
We came here to save this village,

438
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,612
but, no, they killed half my army.

439
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:32,948
Rhesus.

440
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,242
This is all his doing.

441
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,577
And yours.

442
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,245
I warned you.

443
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:41,081
Your men are brave,
but untrained, unprepared for battle.

444
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:43,625
Give me time to make warriors.

445
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:47,838
Very well.

446
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:56,346
Cover up, before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal.

447
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,566
Phineas.

448
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,651
You plead your life.

449
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:11,612
And I gladly offer it.

450
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,115
I failed to see this trap.

451
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,492
The fault is mine!
Spare the other scouts.

452
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:18,952
General Sitacles.

453
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:23,290
I think we've lost enough men
for the day, don't you?

454
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,001
But just to avoid
future misunderstandings,

455
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,171
I'll be taking charge
of your scouts from now on.

456
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,589
Is that clear?

457
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,680
Thank you.

458
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:41,391
Another mistake, I'll end you myself.

459
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:17,052
I'm applying a salve of mint,
chamomile and clay to seal the wound.

460
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:21,014
This is extract of lithops for the pain,
a powerful sedative.

461
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:24,684
It should rest you after consuming it.
It may have certain side effects.

462
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:25,811
I don't need it.

463
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,148
Forgive me, I forgot.
No mortal can harm Hercules.

464
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:34,444
And your lion's hide is indestructible?

465
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,198
Drink, son of Zeus.

466
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,788
Arius' father was the same,
he distrusted medicines.

467
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:46,123
Where is he now?

468
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,419
Taken by the gods
before my son was born.

469
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:51,545
I'm sorry.

470
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:53,797
I never knew my father.

471
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,343
Well, he must have been
very, very strong.

472
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:03,974
Tell me about Arius.

473
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,643
He's a good boy.

474
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,646
And someday, he will make a fine king.

475
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,314
Do you have any children?

476
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,736
Do they live in Athens?

477
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:19,322
Thank you for your care.

478
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,042
The sedative will help you rest.

479
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:07,496
How could you do such a terrible thing?

480
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,372
By law, I should execute you,

481
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:13,043
but I believe a more fitting punishment
would be to let you live.

482
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,838
So you can walk the earth in torment,
haunted by the knowledge

483
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:20,884
that you alone are responsible
for the death of your loved ones.

484
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:25,180
The great Hercules.

485
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:29,226
Hands forever stained
with innocent blood.

486
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,812
Get out, you monster.

487
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:33,897
Get out!

488
00:46:46,137 --> 00:46:47,804
No!

489
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,971
It happened again, didn't it?

490
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:35,268
Another vision of Cerberus,
the three-headed beast of Hades?

491
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:38,563
The gods show you things
they don't share with others.

492
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,108
There's a word for that. Madness.

493
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,611
When we were driven from Athens,

494
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,197
I consulted the Oracle of Delphi
on your behalf.

495
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:49,074
Do you remember her prophecy?

496
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,244
"Hercules must finish the Labor
that remains unfinished."

497
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,955
And what is that, Hercules?

498
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,626
Confront the beast that haunts you.
Only then will you find peace.

499
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,795
I speak from experience.

500
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:05,548
No matter how far you run, no matter
how fast you go, the beast will follow.

501
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,510
Man cannot escape his fate.

502
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,903
Room for one more in your company?

503
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:31,533
It'd be a pleasure having
female companionship for a change.

504
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:34,285
Atalanta doesn't quite count.
No offense.

505
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:36,871
If only your manhood
was as long as your tongue.

506
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,457
Both can satisfy in different ways.

507
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:46,714
You're a famed storyteller, Iolaus.
Grace me with a story.

508
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:49,801
Any particular subject, My Lady?

509
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,847
Murder, of a woman
and her three children.

510
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,686
Is it true?
Did Hercules slaughter his own family?

511
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:02,313
- Who said so?
- Soldiers talk.

512
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:05,567
They say if Hercules
ever returns to Athens,

513
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,610
King Eurystheus will have him executed.

514
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:15,952
Hercules had completed his Labors
and returned home. But Hera...

515
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,746
No myths. I want the truth.

516
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,582
No one knows the truth.

517
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,042
Not for sure.

518
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:28,465
We found Hercules alone.
His wife, Megara and the children, dead.

519
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:29,883
He remembers nothing.

520
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,343
Do you believe he is innocent?

521
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:38,600
We grew up together, both orphans,
trying to survive in the streets of Athens.

522
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:42,187
We found a home in the army.
Looked out for each other.

523
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:47,233
Hercules' strength set him apart.

524
00:49:47,735 --> 00:49:51,029
Kings of Athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions.

525
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,113
The Twelve Labors.

526
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:53,907
And he took me with him.

527
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,493
To fight by his side.

528
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,454
And with each mission,
our numbers grew.

529
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:04,042
Scythia, the Amazon kingdom where
the royal family had been assassinated.

530
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,794
My family was gone.
Everyone was gone.

531
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,631
Hercules helped me
avenge their murder.

532
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,591
He became my brother-in-arms.

533
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:15,220
Thebes, the city of corpses,

534
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,722
where we found a single child,

535
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,724
still alive.

536
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:22,519
Hercules took Tydeus in when

537
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:25,271
everyone else saw
nothing but a wild animal.

538
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:29,901
You know how a rumor spreads.
How a legend grows.

539
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,237
Hercules' deeds were so incredible,

540
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,490
they could not possibly
have been performed by a mere mortal.

541
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,117
So we played along.

542
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:42,580
We encourage people to think
Hercules was the son of Zeus. It's good.

543
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,207
Scares the enemy.

544
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:46,000
Iolaus helps.

545
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,835
He talks nice.

546
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:52,298
You're very loyal friends.

547
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,675
You're avoiding my question.

548
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:56,970
Hercules is a warrior.

549
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,805
And there is something
that haunts warriors.

550
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,390
It can cloud their minds.

551
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,434
We call it the Blood Rage.

552
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,396
This rage afflicted Hercules.

553
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,732
He made me vow
to keep the world away from him.

554
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,569
To make sure that he would
never harm innocents again.

555
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:15,655
And that, My Lady, is the truth.

556
00:51:15,823 --> 00:51:17,198
The truth,

557
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,661
whatever the truth,

558
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,664
the death of his loved ones
haunts Hercules.

559
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,292
Only the gods can help him,

560
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,295
if he listens.

561
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:40,346
Come! Gather around,
soldiers of Thrace, and behold,

562
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:43,433
when Hercules gives an order,
even the gods listen.

563
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:45,852
Zeus' master ironsmith,

564
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,229
using the forges of your own citadel,

565
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:52,859
has crafted these divine weapons
that will make you invincible.

566
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,111
As steel is hewn into shields,

567
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,656
so, too, will you be hewn into warriors.

568
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,954
You shall carry the shield of Hercules!

569
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:14,631
It's lighter.

570
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:17,634
Infused with the souls
of Stymphalian birds

571
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,552
from Hercules' sixth Labor!

572
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,930
Spirits of birds?
How does that work, exactly?

573
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,768
Well, much as birds take flight,

574
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,480
so, too, are these shields
lighter than air. It's in the fibers. Here.

575
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:33,566
Try on the helmet of Hercules.

576
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,325
It covers my whole face.

577
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:47,038
Forged after Hercules' very own helmet,
when he defeated the demon Geryon.

578
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,625
You sure it wasn't your horseshit
that frightened Geryon to death?

579
00:52:52,461 --> 00:52:54,420
General Sitacles,

580
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,757
perhaps you would care to inspect
the armor of Hercules?

581
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,399
Leather armor?

582
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:19,028
We will be skewered like pigs.

583
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,158
Linothorax.

584
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:28,579
Hewn from the skin of
the Erymanthean Boar.

585
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,540
It's indestructible.

586
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,212
Wait. If it's indestructible,
how did Hercules cut it off the boar?

587
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:40,425
He used an indestructible blade.

588
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:12,331
Get up.

589
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:14,667
Next!

590
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,010
Again!

591
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:25,803
Both eyes open.

592
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,140
Keep practicing.

593
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,144
Firmer grip.

594
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,313
Elbow up.

595
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,690
Good.

596
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,442
Shield wall! Form!

597
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,449
Stand tall.

598
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,536
Excellent.

599
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,856
Careful you don't cut yourself, boy.

600
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,235
Again!

601
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:31,994
Rhesus is here.

602
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,413
Close enough to stick
a blade between his ribs.

603
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,748
What did you see?

604
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:39,043
Centaurs. Half man, half horse.
Hundreds of them.

605
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:41,754
He saw shadows in the night.

606
00:55:41,922 --> 00:55:44,257
My Lord,
I will go ahead into the Rhesus camp.

607
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,093
I will bring word of his plans.

608
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:54,433
If we let them get past Mount Asticus,
Thrace will fall.

609
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,727
You want to stop Rhesus?

610
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,813
We'll go through the forest
and they'll never see us coming.

611
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,941
It'll slow down our chariots. A gamble.

612
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:03,943
I have a plan.

613
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,991
The scouts have returned.

614
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:13,744
Rhesus has made his camp
in Mount Asticus, 72 leagues away.

615
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,372
Once these men are ready, we march.

616
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:20,626
So, have you seen if we win or lose?

617
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,422
The gods have been annoyingly silent
on that matter.

618
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,382
What they have told me is that

619
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,385
I'm soon to discover
there truly is a heaven or a hell.

620
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,388
When will you die?

621
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,850
Within a week in a place
that looks an awful lot like hell.

622
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:40,146
As always,
the gods are generous with hints,

623
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,398
but cheap on specifics.

624
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,360
Cheer up, Hercules.

625
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:50,489
I've lived, not always well,
but long enough.

626
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:54,869
I'm ready for what's next.

627
00:57:00,709 --> 00:57:03,544
Thracians, halt!

628
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,006
Shield wall! Form!

629
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,428
Battle positions!

630
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,308
Tydeus?

631
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,814
There is no enemy camp.

632
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,733
This is the right place.

633
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,752
Centaurs!

634
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,838
They're real.

635
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,363
It seems that we're expected.

636
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,963
Centaurs?

637
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:33,319
Rhesus!

638
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:37,865
You have come looking for a fight,
and we are happy to oblige.

639
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,577
Hercules. The son of Zeus.

640
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,246
Your legend ends here.

641
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:45,331
Look at me.

642
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,833
Do I look afraid?

643
00:59:56,468 --> 00:59:57,676
Phineas.

644
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,513
Traitor!

645
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,223
Hades will have you!

646
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,767
After it has you, My Lord.

647
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,936
It is over, Cotys.

648
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:10,731
Mount Asticus on your front.
The woods at your back.

649
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:13,359
And my troops outman you three to one.

650
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:18,781
Surrender now
and we shall consider being merciful.

651
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,450
Men die who speak to my lord
in such a manner.

652
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:29,542
You've made your choice.

653
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,392
Go!

654
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:01,365
In this moment, on this day,

655
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,910
become the man you were born to be!

656
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,915
You have it within yourselves
to write your own legends!

657
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:14,336
Let it be to death or victory!

658
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,134
Charge!

659
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:29,935
Shield wall!

660
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:32,897
Flanks out!

661
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,616
Maybe today.

662
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,347
Now!

663
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,910
Watch as the Amazon
uses the arrows of Artemis...

664
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,453
Silence, boy!

665
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:36,168
Spears forward!

666
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,522
Archers, ready!

667
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,149
Loose!

668
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:51,827
Advance!

669
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,588
Set them aflame!

670
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:08,635
Take cover!

671
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,388
Defend Lord Cotys!

672
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:32,242
Maybe not.

673
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,328
Shield wall! Attack!

674
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,416
Push forward!

675
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:56,058
To kill a snake, cut off its head.

676
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:15,035
Victory is yours, Lord Cotys!

677
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,663
It is not over yet!

678
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,365
Fucking centaurs.

679
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:03,876
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

680
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:07,838
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

681
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,382
Hail, Lord Cotys!

682
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:38,952
Halt!

683
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:47,252
Get up.

684
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:49,713
Get up.

685
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:58,263
- Up.
- Enough!

686
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,777
You helped a tyrant enslave a nation.

687
01:07:12,528 --> 01:07:15,030
All I did was stop you from
burning more villages.

688
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,531
I burned no villages.

689
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,533
Then who did?

690
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,869
Ask yourself, if Cotys is beloved,

691
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:23,163
why did he need to hire mercenaries
to do his dirty work?

692
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:24,748
Keep moving, dog.

693
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,876
You've been fighting on the wrong side.

694
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,120
Where are you going?

695
01:08:03,204 --> 01:08:05,205
I'm taking some water to the prisoner.

696
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,667
Sit down.

697
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,757
It's time.

698
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,854
Thrace is finally united.

699
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,691
One land,

700
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,609
one King,

701
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,779
one Thrace.

702
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,282
One land!

703
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:42,659
One King! One Thrace!

704
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,620
Thrace is not a man, a king, or a god!

705
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,622
Thrace is her people!

706
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:57,549
Who cares what Rhesus claims?
Our work is done.

707
01:08:57,633 --> 01:08:59,259
Let's collect our fee and be gone.

708
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:12,647
Don't do anything foolish.

709
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,361
Where are you going?

710
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:25,869
I saw pity in your eyes for Rhesus.

711
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,579
Why?

712
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,373
Look at me.

713
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:31,833
Cotys is responsible for this war,
isn't he?

714
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:39,674
You lie very well.
Clearly, your father's daughter.

715
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:44,221
I didn't do it for my father.
I did it for my son.

716
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:49,476
If I disobeyed Cotys or resisted
in any way, Arius would be executed.

717
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:53,021
I did what any mother would.
I protected my child.

718
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,566
My husband was king.

719
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:59,111
And Cotys poisoned him
to take his place.

720
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,322
Rhesus fought back. Civil war broke out.

721
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:05,200
Arius is the legitimate king.

722
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,037
My father is old.

723
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:12,582
He will not live forever,
and once he is gone,

724
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,710
my son will be a good king.

725
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:18,922
And he will heal this land.

726
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,257
That's a dream.

727
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,635
And you can help.

728
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,721
Please, when you leave Thrace,
take Arius with you.

729
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,598
Please keep him safe.

730
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:31,017
Find another savior.

731
01:10:31,602 --> 01:10:32,602
Hercules?

732
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:36,731
The King commands your presence.

733
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:43,530
My Lady.

734
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,918
Champion of Thrace!

735
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,087
Something tells me
we're not gonna get paid.

736
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,883
- You could be right.
- Oh, shit.

737
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,221
You wanted conquerors, not heroes.

738
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:10,390
You betrayed me, Cotys.

739
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,225
Betrayed?

740
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:17,272
A mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold

741
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:19,774
can hardly presume to
judge his employers.

742
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:22,194
Let's not quibble about details.

743
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:31,203
We all know your legend, Hercules.
But here is mine.

744
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:34,039
When I was a general
in the army of Thrace,

745
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,791
I had dreams of ruling this kingdom.

746
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:40,170
But thanks to you,
my dreams have grown.

747
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:43,089
I now crave an empire.

748
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:48,386
My thousands will train more thousands,
and they even more.

749
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,555
The lessons of Hercules will spread.

750
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,391
What you began here
can never be stopped.

751
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:57,521
And if you fear
what such an army may do,

752
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,148
then lead it.

753
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,322
You want me to serve you?

754
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,867
Spare me the moral outrage.

755
01:12:11,953 --> 01:12:13,203
Child killer.

756
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,833
Getting us all killed, bad idea.

757
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:26,216
Well, I must take this as a "no."

758
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:28,552
In that case,

759
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:32,597
your services are no longer required.

760
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:39,646
You will be paid in full.
Bring them the gold.

761
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:25,066
If we hurry, we can be spending
our fortunes in Macedonia.

762
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,821
Take mine, too.

763
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,368
What do you think you're doing?
Let's go.

764
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,163
There will be no more innocent blood
on my hands.

765
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,749
I can't leave without setting this right.

766
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,835
I see.

767
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:47,213
And who's gonna be paying us
for this suicidal endeavor?

768
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:48,673
Thrace needs our help.

769
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:50,759
To hell with Thrace. We have gold.

770
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:52,927
You remember the Black Sea.

771
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:57,015
That beach you spoke of is within reach.
Leave now, be free.

772
01:13:59,477 --> 01:14:01,353
I would never be free.

773
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:06,441
In this fight, you're alone.

774
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,154
Never saw that one coming.

775
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:13,323
- How can you just walk away?
- You can't just leave.

776
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:15,450
- Why not?
- It's all right.

777
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:19,412
You've sacrificed your lives for me.
Now you can finally be free.

778
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,623
Whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid.

779
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,375
Debt?

780
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:27,629
You think we follow you
because we owe you?

781
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,131
Look around, Hercules.

782
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,550
We're family.

783
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:34,969
All we have is each other.

784
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:40,308
We will fight for you.
And if it's our time, we will die for you.

785
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,352
Because you would die for us.

786
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:47,148
Take that, too. I have no need of it.

787
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,317
This is madness.

788
01:14:49,402 --> 01:14:50,902
You want madness?

789
01:14:50,986 --> 01:14:54,280
Tonight, a spear of flame
will pierce my heart.

790
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:58,993
Is that not the most insane death
you've ever heard of?

791
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,257
Crazy. The lot of you.

792
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,008
Autolycus.

793
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,637
Iolaus. Go with Autolycus.

794
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:19,681
I think I'll stay.

795
01:15:19,849 --> 01:15:20,849
Nephew.

796
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:26,062
Uncle, all I've ever done is tell stories
of great deeds performed by others.

797
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:31,985
It's time I stopped telling their stories.
Started living my own.

798
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:36,030
Well, you may have all
completely lost your minds, but not me.

799
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:38,867
Not me.

800
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:43,246
Autolycus?

801
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:48,877
Live like a king, my friend.

802
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,180
What about Cotys?

803
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:05,310
He paid us to save Thrace.

804
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:06,853
Let's not disappoint him.

805
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,967
Lay down your arms.

806
01:16:39,845 --> 01:16:41,429
Lay down your arms!

807
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:45,099
Or your nephew dies first.

808
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:04,953
I invite you to join me. You refuse.

809
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,289
I order you to leave. You return.

810
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,042
Get your hands off me.

811
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:16,089
I overheard her
conspiring with Hercules.

812
01:17:16,423 --> 01:17:19,300
They were planning to remove
the young Prince from your protection.

813
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:25,974
No.

814
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:28,977
Let go of him! Don't touch him!

815
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,440
Arius! No!

816
01:17:38,863 --> 01:17:40,655
No! You're hurting him! No!

817
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,157
Hercules, no! Help me! Stop!

818
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:46,160
- Help! No!
- Arius. No.

819
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,162
Arius! No!

820
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,587
Magnificent, aren't they?

821
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:42,800
An extraordinary species.
Incredibly loyal.

822
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,595
As long as they're fed.

823
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,348
- Remember them?
- Eurystheus.

824
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:51,893
They remember you.

825
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:55,146
Confused, Hercules?

826
01:18:56,398 --> 01:19:01,069
Kingdoms are won with armies,
but empires are made by alliances.

827
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:06,991
King Eurystheus and I
will now rule all of Greece.

828
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:16,668
Cerberus only exists in my mind.

829
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:20,254
Speak a little louder, Hercules.

830
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,758
I didn't quite catch that.

831
01:19:25,928 --> 01:19:27,261
The wolves.

832
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,849
They were there that night.

833
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,477
The wolves were there.

834
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,270
You drugged me.

835
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:55,623
The wolves were there
the night my family was murdered.

836
01:19:59,545 --> 01:20:02,130
My men told me
how your children screamed

837
01:20:03,382 --> 01:20:05,842
as my wolves gnawed on their bones.

838
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:11,305
As their fangs despoiled your daughter's

839
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:13,182
pure flesh.

840
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:18,187
When the people called out your name
louder than mine,

841
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:21,649
you see, when they saw you as a god,

842
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,943
how long before
they saw you as their king?

843
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:25,528
I wanted nothing!

844
01:20:25,696 --> 01:20:29,240
Precisely! Your sin, Hercules,
was that you had no ambition!

845
01:20:29,324 --> 01:20:31,868
I can deal with an ambitious man!
He can be bought!

846
01:20:31,952 --> 01:20:34,787
But a man who wants nothing
has no price!

847
01:20:37,082 --> 01:20:39,584
Killing you would have
turned Athens against me.

848
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,753
I had to ruin your name.

849
01:20:45,924 --> 01:20:47,258
My wife!

850
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:50,011
My children!

851
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:53,014
Well, you have our permission
to join them in death.

852
01:20:53,182 --> 01:20:57,351
All of you!
Starting with my faithless daughter!

853
01:20:58,103 --> 01:21:00,104
No! Get off me!

854
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,024
No! No! No!

855
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:05,651
Unhand me! No!

856
01:21:06,195 --> 01:21:07,653
She's your own flesh and blood!

857
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,198
I will raise Arius to be
my worthy successor!

858
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:14,827
You stay away from my boy!
You monster, you bastard!

859
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:18,498
- You are a monster! You are a monster!
- No!

860
01:21:19,166 --> 01:21:22,502
You are not a man! You're a demon!

861
01:21:22,836 --> 01:21:24,337
Who are you?

862
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,339
Are you a murderer?

863
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:29,008
Damn you! I curse you!

864
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:31,552
Are you a mercenary
who turns his back on the innocent?

865
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,346
Stay away from my son!

866
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:34,889
Are you only the legend?

867
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:38,726
Or are you the truth behind the legend?

868
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:40,520
No! Father, please, please, please.

869
01:21:40,604 --> 01:21:41,604
We believe in you.

870
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,482
We have faith in you.

871
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,567
Have faith in yourself.

872
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:47,944
Save me!

873
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:49,737
Remember the man that you are.

874
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,282
Father, the gods will punish you!
You cannot escape this time!

875
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:55,701
Remember the deeds
you have performed,

876
01:21:55,869 --> 01:21:57,036
the Labors you have accomplished!

877
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,122
No! No!

878
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,499
- Stop it!
- Leave her alone!

879
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:03,668
Now, tell me!

880
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:04,752
Please!

881
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:07,588
Who are you?

882
01:22:07,756 --> 01:22:11,759
I am Hercules!

883
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:24,272
Unleash the wolves!

884
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:29,819
Get away!

885
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,622
Three wolves should be
more than enough for one lion.

886
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,335
Hurry!

887
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:53,843
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

888
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:58,472
No!

889
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,251
The gods have revealed your innocence.

890
01:23:27,419 --> 01:23:29,754
The final Labor is complete.

891
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,006
But I'm just getting started.

892
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,225
Doesn't take a vision to know
what's waiting for us up there.

893
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,089
My time.

894
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,727
Excuse me.
That was my moment, my fate.

895
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,312
You're welcome.

896
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,494
I'm going after Eurystheus!

897
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:07,893
Hercules, listen to me.
None of this is my fault.

898
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:11,981
You see, Cotys poisoned my mind.
Turned me against you.

899
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:13,816
I like you.

900
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:15,276
No, stop.

901
01:25:15,902 --> 01:25:18,946
I command you to stop! I'm your King!
You took an oath to obey me!

902
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,365
You swore to Zeus!

903
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:22,450
Wait, wait, wait.

904
01:25:23,702 --> 01:25:27,079
You fight for gold. I have plenty of gold.
Name your price.

905
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,999
Find it in your heart to forgive.

906
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,340
You want forgiveness?

907
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,816
Ask my family for forgiveness.

908
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:16,545
I've never killed a god before.

909
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:28,682
I really think I'm ready to fight now.

910
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,563
Well done, warrior.

911
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:48,327
- Eurystheus?
- Dead.

912
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:50,538
- We need to find Arius.
- Follow me.

913
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,054
Soldiers of Thrace!

914
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,850
You followed me in battle.
Follow me now.

915
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:13,102
Don't be fools!

916
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:16,313
Hercules is mortal! Not a god!

917
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,693
Anyone who sides with him will die!

918
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,863
And I will show you.

919
01:27:24,322 --> 01:27:25,573
Bring him.

920
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,328
- Arius!
- Mama!

921
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:33,873
No! He's your grandson!

922
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,168
You failed to save
your children, Hercules.

923
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,336
But you may yet save him.

924
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,546
Please, Father! No!

925
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:42,590
Admit defeat!

926
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:44,592
Bow to me!

927
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,762
You have until the count of three!

928
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:52,933
One!

929
01:27:53,977 --> 01:27:54,977
Two!

930
01:27:58,023 --> 01:27:59,815
Don't just stand there! Kill someone!

931
01:28:01,610 --> 01:28:03,110
Protect Lord Cotys!

932
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,448
Arius, run!

933
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:08,616
Mother!

934
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:10,951
Get the boy!

935
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,173
Tydeus!

936
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:10,844
Attack!

937
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,430
Hold them back!

938
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:30,573
Spears!

939
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,413
Go through the fire!

940
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:46,130
Here! Here! Help! Come on!

941
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,343
Easy, Tydeus.

942
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:23,334
Hercules.

943
01:30:44,481 --> 01:30:45,814
Lock shields!

944
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,525
March!

945
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:52,529
Find peace, my brother.

946
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:13,550
As you said, Hercules,
there is no way to defeat a shield wall!

947
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:16,345
There is no way out!

948
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:19,390
Come out and face me!

949
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:30,192
You're no hero! You're no god!

950
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:33,320
You're nothing but a mercenary!

951
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:36,198
Your wife and children deserved to die!

952
01:31:58,763 --> 01:31:59,847
What're you doing?

953
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:01,724
Get back up there!

954
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:04,518
Hercules must die!

955
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,772
Come on!

956
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:14,236
Kill that filthy bastard!

957
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:16,840
Hercules! Hercules!

958
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:20,928
Hercules! Hercules!

959
01:33:21,095 --> 01:33:26,391
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

960
01:33:26,476 --> 01:33:30,145
Hercules! Hercules!

961
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:35,442
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

962
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:40,364
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

963
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:43,283
You want to know
the truth about Hercules?

964
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,285
There it is.

965
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,623
To be honest, I prefer it to the legend.

966
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:53,502
The world needs a hero
they can believe in.

967
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,339
Is he actually the son of Zeus?

968
01:33:58,007 --> 01:34:00,342
I don't think it really matters.

969
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:04,221
You don't need to be
a demigod to be a hero.

970
01:34:04,681 --> 01:34:07,683
You just need to believe you're a hero.

971
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:10,519
It's what worked for him.

972
01:34:12,146 --> 01:34:16,316
But then again, what the hell do I know?

973
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:19,695
I'm supposed to be dead by now.
