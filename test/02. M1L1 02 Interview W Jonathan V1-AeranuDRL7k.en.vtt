00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.859
You're probably really excited to get started,

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:04.634
but maybe you have a few questions,

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:06.044
like what's a quant?

00:00:06.044 --> 00:00:07.905
And what does a quant do?

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.120
We were really lucky when building this nanodegree program.

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:14.474
We got to work with some of the leading players in the quant world.

00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:16.589
To tell you a little more about that world,

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.100
we have Jonathan Larkin,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.340
a strategist in quantitative equities.

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.870
He's held senior positions in

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.240
quantitative equity trading at several of the leading financial institutions.
