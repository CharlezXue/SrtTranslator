this field is that there really is no typical day.

That being said, the work product of a Quant is to create a model.

That could be a model of financial time series or it could

People who have achieved substantial success in other scientific disciplines
在其他科学学科取得巨大成功的人在进入量化金融时往往会感到谦卑。

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.879
are often humbled when they come to quantitative finance.


00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:26.894
The reason for this is that signals in financial data are very, very faint,
