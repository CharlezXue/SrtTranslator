00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.610
In his book, The Quants,

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.905
Scott Patterson really hit the nail on the head.

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.714
He described Quants as those searching for the truth.

00:00:06.714 --> 00:00:09.869
The truth being the universal underlying hidden dynamics

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.849
in the markets and that has always captivated me.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:15.250
Quants build computational models of the world.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.679
Specifically, that could be about financial instruments or markets,

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.114
and Quants apply the scientific method to finance.

00:00:23.114 --> 00:00:27.130
You'll find Quants working across the entire financial industry these days.

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:30.304
Most people associate the job of a Quant with

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:33.515
very well known quantitative hedge funds and

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:36.859
it is certainly true that Quants work in that type of organization,

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.655
but Quants also work in commercial banks, proprietary trading firms,

00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:45.158
asset management firms, data vendor firms,

00:00:45.158 --> 00:00:47.734
and they also work across functions.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:53.519
You'll find Quants working in many aspects of a investment organization.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.925
You'll find Quants in the research function.

00:00:55.924 --> 00:00:58.699
Those are Quants looking for predictive signals and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.755
data that can be applied downstream to a portfolio.

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:05.600
You'll find Quants working in risk management trying to

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.890
predict the risk of a particular portfolio or the risk firm wide.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.724
You'll find Quants working in portfolio construction,

00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:17.549
combining the signals and models produced by other Quants.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.134
You'll also find Quants working in data vendors,

00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:23.969
data vendors who are preparing unstructured data,

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.039
then to sell to the financial industry.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.910
One of the reasons that I'm so fascinated with

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.375
this field is that there really is no typical day.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:37.170
That being said, the work product of a Quant is to create a model.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.640
That could be a model of financial time series or it could

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.090
be the model of a portfolio or firm-wide risk,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.000
or it could be a model to reduce

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.834
unstructured data to structured form for further use in the investment process.

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:57.818
One thing that makes this field fascinating is that things are always changing.

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.935
There's new developments in markets.

00:01:59.935 --> 00:02:01.400
There are new datasets.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.525
There are new computational techniques.

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:06.160
You always need to keep learning and you

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.444
always need to continually up your game in order to compete.

00:02:09.444 --> 00:02:14.590
People who have achieved substantial success in other scientific disciplines

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.879
are often humbled when they come to quantitative finance.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:26.894
The reason for this is that signals in financial data are very, very faint,

00:02:26.895 --> 00:02:30.560
and you need to combine not just a scientific approach,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.469
but you need to combine that with understanding of markets,

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:38.425
intuition of markets, and domain knowledge about markets.

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:42.740
For example, take Isaac Newton who experienced significant stock trading losses

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.480
in his personal account and is quoted as

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.060
saying "I can predict the movements of the heavens,

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.920
but I cannot predict the madness of people."
